        "summary": "This research marks a significant step forward in Tamil language processing, particularly in the area of masked word prediction. By fine-tuning models on low-resource Tamil datasets, we have demonstrated that even with limited data, substantial progress can be achieved in understanding Tamil syntax and semantics. The model's coherence score of 0.750 further highlights the logical flow in the model's generated outputs. The perplexity value of 150.000 reveals occasional challenges in predicting the correct word for the MASK token. The model often selects contextually meaningful words, underscoring the effectiveness of combining BERT and SBERT. Future advancements can be made by incorporating ensemble learning and additional models. Ensemble methods can mitigate individual model weaknesses and provide a more robust understanding of complex linguistic patterns. Fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets and leveraging auxiliary models for tasks like language modeling and data augmentation could further refine outputs and enhance the model's overall performance. This approach has the potential to scale to other low-resource Dravidian languages with similar linguistic characteristics, such as Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam. Adapting the method to these languages will involve fine-tuning the model with appropriate datasets and evaluating the generalizability of tokenization and semantic parsing strategies."
